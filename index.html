      <p>Hello! My name's Craig Buckler and I'm a freelance web consultant from Devon.</p>

      <p>I'm a full-stack developer but primarily concentrate on the front-end.</p>

      <p>I also:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>write articles for SitePoint.com</li>
        <li>create training videos</li>
        <li>talk at conferences</li>
        <li>prostitute myself to whoever needs me</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My name's fairly distinct so you can find me on the usual websites, social networks and GitHub.</p>

      <p>Today we're going to discuss whether you really need jQuery.</p>

    <h1>jQuery is not&hellip;</h1>

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">a language</li>
      <li class="fragment">essential</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">

      <p>It's not:</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> A language in it's own right.</p>

      <p>jQuery syntax is JavaScript syntax.</p>

      <p>It has a slightly different feel in some respects but it's still native JavaScript below the surface.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> Neither is jQuery an essential part of modern web development.</p>

      <p>Although you'd be forgiven for thinking so.</p>

      <p>Like any library or framework, jQuery can help you write code</p>

      <p>but the same functionality can be implemented without jQuery should you need to do so.</p>

    <h1>Why we use jQuery?</h1>

    <p class="left">Ten years ago&hellip;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>client-side heavy applications were new</li>

      <li class="fragment">but development was tough<br />
        <img src="assets/images/ie-error.png" alt="IE error" />
      </li>

      <li class="fragment">browsers were buggy and inconsistent</li>
      <li class="fragment">for many, JavaScript was new and strange</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">

      <p>Let's look at the history of jQuery.</p>

      <p>In 2004, developers became interested in client-side browser applications.</p>

      <p>Ajax was increasingly popular. And modern web apps such as GMail and Google Maps had started to appear.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> But behind the scenes, browsers were a hostile environment.</p>

      <p>Microsoft had abandoned Internet Explorer but it was still the most-used browser.</p>

      <p>There were few tools and the best you could hope for was cryptic messages like this.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> we had a couple of competing browsers such as Firefox and Opera</p>

      <p>but they adopted newer W3C standards and weren't necessarily compatible with IE.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> also, for many developers coming from backend or desktop languages, JavaScript seemed a little weird and difficult to comprehend.</p>

    </aside>

  </section>


  <section>
    <h1>JavaScript libraries</h1>

    <img src="assets/images/js-library.svg" alt="JavaScript library" class="noback" />

    <aside class="notes">

      <p>In 2004 developers had a handful of desktop browsers to support.</p>

      <p>So they created helper functions which smoothed over the inconsistencies.</p>

      <p>And these functions were wrapped into into libraries and released into the open source community.</p>

      <p>We saw the launch of projects such as Prototype and MooTools which made development easier.</p>

      <p>But then the iPhone, Android and other mobiles started to arrive.</p>

      <p>We suddenly had numerous different devices, browsers, APIs and bugs to content with.</p>

      <p>Using a JavaScript library became essential.</p>

    </aside>

  </section>


  <section>
    <h1>The rise of jQuery</h1>

    <pre><code>// a single object for everything
$;</code></pre>

    <pre class="fragment"><code>// CSS selector syntax
$("#main-section .name");</code></pre>

    <pre class="fragment"><code>// concise method chaining
$("#main-section .name").text("hello").addClass("new").slideDown();</code></pre>

    <aside class="notes">

      <p>Now jQuery was launched in 2006 and arrived a little late to the party.</p>

      <p>It's developer - John Resig - learned from the competing libraries which had started to become large and cumbersome.</p>

      <p>He devised a number of elegant features.</p>

      <p>First everything you do in jQuery is handled via single object - normally represented by the dollar sign.</p>

      <p>It's simple and ties functionality to the HTML elements you want to interact with.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> next, you could select elements from the DOM using CSS selectors.</p>

      <p>Now this seems obvious now but it was revolutionary at the time.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> jQuery offered method chaining.</p>

      <p>Most methods return the jQuery object itself. This means it can be passed into another method to act on the same set of elements.</p>

      <p>So here we have a selection of elements where we're setting the text to "Hello", adding a class, and running a slideDown animation.</p>

      <p>It's concise. It's easy to read. Even developers with little experience could understand it.</p>

      <p>This made jQuery phenomenally successful.</p>

  <section data-background="assets/images/statistics.jpg">
    <h1>jQuery usage in 2014</h1>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> it's almost 60 percent</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> so what about the top 10 thousand websites? Any guesses?</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> it rises to almost 80%</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> finally, if we only look at sites which are using a JavaScript library, what proportion of those use jQuery?</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> it's almost 95 percent. jQuery wins. Everyone else might as well give up.</p>

      <p>So let's look at the good parts of jQuery.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> selecting DOM nodes using CSS selectors was inspired.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> method chaining offers a consistent and easy to read API</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> you rarely worry about cross-browser support because jQuery works everywhere</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> it's easy to learn - new developers can string a few methods together to do something useful</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> the online documentation is great and you can find answers everywhere</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> it covers the core browser APIs:</p>

      <p>that's DOM selection, traversal, node manipulation, event handling, Ajax and a little animation thrown in</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> and you can build on those core features. There are thousands of plugins available.</p>

      <p>the web has changed since jQuery was introduced 8 years ago.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> IE6 and 7 are rarely a problem. Yay!</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> unless you're unlucky, IE8 usage has dropped below 1 in 20 users for most sites.</p>

      <p>(Be aware that jQuery 2 has dropped support for IE8 and below)</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> you may not believe me but IE11 is a good browser (controversial!)</p>

      <p>It's fast and rarely causes more problems than anything else.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> all the vendors are working together to ensure compatibility. It doesn't always work but...</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> the top applications are close than they've ever been</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> and that's true even on mobile devices</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> and finally, the vendors understand the popularity of jQuery - and they've started to add similar APIs to the browsers</p>

      <p>The problems jQuery solved for us don't necessarily exist today</p>

      <p>So let's look at the bad parts.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> you no longer need jQuery to locate nodes by CSS selectors.</p>

    </aside>

  </section>


  <section data-transition="none">
    <h1>Native CSS Selectors</h1>

    <pre><code class="javascript">// returns an array-like NodeList

// returns the first matching element
var f = document.querySelector("#myid .myclass");
    </code></pre>

    <aside class="notes">

      <p>All modern browsers have implemented methods named <strong>querySelector</strong> and <strong>querySelectorAll</strong> which find nodes using CSS selectors just like jQuery.</p>

      <p>{QUESTION} Does anyone know which version of IE first implemented this?</p>

      <p>It's IE8 - although you can only use simpler CSS2.1 selectors</p>

      <p>Below the surface, jQuery uses when querySelectorAll when it can.</p>

      <p>In effect jQuery is a simple wrapper around it.</p>

      <p>So going back to our bad parts...</p>

    </aside>

  </section>


  <section data-transition="none">
    <h1>jQuery:</h1>

    <table class="grid">
      <tr><td class="dim"><h2>the good parts</h2></td><td><h2>the bad parts</h2></td></tr>

    <aside class="notes">

      <p>method chaining looks cool. Until you realise every method loops through every selected node. If you have three methods, that's three loops on the same elements. A single loop should be more effective.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> next: jQuery doesn't support every browser.</p>

      <p>It's great until you encounter a problem with a specific device. It doesn't happen often but when it does, it can be difficult to fix.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> Next problem. And I think you can see where I'm going with this...</p>

      <p>As you saw with chaining, jQuery allows you to implement functionality which works but is spectacularly inefficient.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the code looks concise because jQuery abstracts the implementation.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> what can be wrong with great documentation?</p>

      <p>Visit StackOverflow and ask a question about JavaScript or any other library. 99 times out of 100 you'll get the answer <em>"seriously dude, just use jQuery"</em>.</p>

      <p>jQuery documentation is ubiquitous and that can make it difficult to find information when you're using something else.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> the jQuery core ONLY covers the core APIs. But these are consistent in modern browsers and there are dozens of HTML5 APIs it won't help you with. In fact, you may struggle to use a new API because your jQuery crutch has been kicked away.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> even plugins will only build on the jQuery core. Now you'll find plugins which don't use the core but then -- why are they using jQuery? A self-contained module would be compatible with any library.</p>

    <h1>jQuery Misconceptions</h1>

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">jQuery is perfect</li>

      <li class="fragment">jQuery is only 30Kb</li>
      <li class="fragment">learning JavaScript isn't necessary</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fragment"><br /><em>Are we using jQuery out of habit rather than necessity?</em></p>

    <aside class="notes">

      <p>jQuery's success has also led to several misconceptions within the community.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> jQuery has bugs and issues like any other project. It is robust, but don't expect it to be fault-free.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> this is jQuery's tag line but I don't think it's always true today.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> minified and gzipped jQuery is only 32K. And that's nothing when compared with assets like images.</p>

      <p>In reality, the uncompressed source is nearer 300K and that has a processing and storage overhead.</p>

      <p>We rarely use use more than a fraction of jQuery's functionality yet the whole library is referenced in every object you create.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> finally, the classic: <em>"learning JavaScript isn't necessary because jQuery exists"</em></p>

      <p>Developers may think they understand JavaScript when they know a little jQuery - but they'd struggle without it.</p>

      <p>And don't forget that jQuery may not be around forever. Ask any YUI developer...</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> So are we using jQuery out of habit rather than necessity? That's something I've been guilty of.</p>

    <h1>Raw JavaScript</h1>

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">has become considerably easier</li>
      <li class="fragment">has become cool (again)</li>
      <li class="fragment">it's considerably faster</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">

      <p>So let's look at the benefits of raw JavaScript.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> the core browser APIs are consistent now that oldIEs have died.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> everyone's jumping on the JavaScript bandwagon. It can be used outside the browser - such as on the server in Node.js, in OSes and even embedded systems.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> and it's fast. It's far faster than using jQuery which, as we've seen, is often a wrapper around native methods.</p>

      <p>This performance is increasingly important.</p>

      <p>{QUESTION} How many you are working on sites with a responsive web design?</p>

      <p>We spend many development hours making a site design responsive but put relatively little effort into efficiency or performance.</p>

      <p>The design may be responsive but the user experience isn't.</p>

      <p>So to prove this, let's look at the performance gains you can make by removing your jQuery shackles and running naked and free in the JavaScript world!</p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">// 1: jQuery
$("#programme .name");

// 2: querySelectorAll (IE8+)
document.querySelectorAll("#programme .name");

document.getElementById("programme").getElementsByClassName("name");</code></pre>

    </table>

    <aside class="notes">

      <p>For all these tests I've taken 500 lines of HTML code from Digpen.com and run tests at jsperf.com.</p>

      <p>So we're going to find all Digpen speaker names by looking for elements with a class of 'name' within a section with an id of 'programme'.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> Here are the results for jQuery as a number of operations per second. This is on a mid-range Windows PC but I also verified tests on a Mac.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> So if we use querySelectorAll, we get a 15% performance boost.</p>

      <p>Not huge but that's primarily because jQuery uses querySelectorAll when it's available.</p>

      <p>{QUESTION} But can anyone guess how much faster getElementsByClassName will be?</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> It's hundreds of times faster. Almost 1,000 times faster on Firefox.</p>

      <p>My initial reaction was that I'd written some dodgy test code but I've verified it outside of jsperf using 100 thousand loops. If anything, native JavaScript can be 2,000 times faster and even querySelectorAll was almost twice as fast as jQuery.</p>

      <p>Undoubtedly the browsers are caching nodes and the boost will differ across pages, platforms and applications.</p>

      <p>And you're unlikely to be doing such intensive node selection but it illustrates just how fast raw JavaScript can be.</p>

      <p>In the next test we're going to modify all LIST elements on the page.</p>

      <p>We'll add two class names, toggle one and removing the other.</p>

      <p>Class manipulation is something you do regularly when building client-side applications.</p>

      <p>In all these tests the collection of HTML elements has been cached so there's no additional overhead.</p>

      <p>for the first test, we'll run jQuery methods as separate commands.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> in the second test, we'll improve this by chaining the methods together.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> in the next test, we're going to use the new classList API which is available in IE10 and above. It offers similar add, remove and toggle methods.</p>

      <p>We don't have the benefit of jQuery doing the loop for us, so we'll do four loops - one for each change of class.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> and in the final test, we'll still use the classList API but do everything in a single loop which you'd expect to be more efficient.</p>

    <h1>Class manipulation</h1>

    <table class="tests">
      <tr><th>test (ops/sec)</th><th>Chrome 37</th><th>Firefox 32</th><th>IE11</th></tr>

      <tr><td>jQuery single</td><td>1,650</td><td>390</td><td>620</td></tr>

      <tr><td>jQuery chain</td><td>1,610</td><td>390</td><td>600</td></tr>

      <tr class="fragment"><td>4 classList loops</td><td>2,060 <span>(+24%)</span></td><td>820 <span>(2.1x)</span></td><td>1,000 <span>(+60%)</span></td></tr>

    </table>

    <aside class="notes">

      <p>So for the results for jQuery in operations per second show very little difference between running multiple or chained methods.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, Firefox seems quite slow at class name handling.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> but even if you use the classList API in individual loops, you can expect a performance gain of 25% - or twice as fast on Firefox.</p>

      <p>One of the reasons for this boost is because jQuery doesn't use the classList API. It determines what it needs to add and remove using string analysis and concatenation.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> If we look at the single loop, we get a small boost on all browsers except Firefox which, for some reason, appears to prefer multiple loops? I don't know why.</p>

    <aside class="notes">

      <p>In the next test we're changing the text of all the speaker names.</p>

      <p>The first test uses jQuery's text method.</p>

      <p>The second test uses the textContent method which is available in IE9 and above.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> so the jQuery results. IE's performance is shockingly slow.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> but by using the textContent method, it's at least twice as fast. In fact, Firefox is 5 times faster and overtakes Chrome's performance.</p>

      <p>In this final test we're going to add a child node to all speaker elements to show that they've been confirmed and then remove it again.</p>

      <p>This is quite simple in jQuery.</p>

      <p>But for the native test, I tried to make it as slow as possible. I used multiple loops and some clunky DOM creation methods rather than innerHTML which is what jQuery uses and is normally faster.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> jQuery's results are similar to the text change test.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> but despite all this horrible code, the native JavaScript is at least twice as fast.</p>

      <p>Or 4 times faster on Firefox.</p>

    <h1>Performance gains</h1>

    <p>Similar gains can be made for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>arrays</li>
      <li class="fragment">loops</li>
      <li class="fragment">event handling</li>
      <li class="fragment">Ajax</li>
    </ul>


    <aside class="notes">

      <p>These gains will be repeated elsewhere:</p>

      <p>arrays have new methods such as <strong>map</strong> and <strong>every</strong> which can be more efficient than the loops we used earlier</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> jQuery's .each() method can be replaced using JavaScript's faster forEach statement</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> event handling is consistent so you rarely need the overhead of a jQuery wrapper</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> and similarly, jQuery's Ajax handling is quite complex.</p>

      <p>it caters for multiple situations and you're unlikely to require them all.</p>

      <p>In IE10 and above you can use XMLHttpRequest2.</p>

      <p>which has advanced methods for things like progress bars, files and binary data which jQuery won't help you with.</p>

      <p>In fact, there's only one exception I'd make...</p>

    <h1>Animations</h1>

    <p>Don't bother with jQuery or JavaScript<br /><br /></p>

    <h2 class="fragment grow">use CSS3</h2>


    <aside class="notes">

      <p>that's animations</p>

      <p>jQuery offers simple slides, fades and scrolling.</p>

      <p>They work in all browsers, but really - just forget jQuery and JavaScript.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> Use CSS3 animations and transformations.</p>

      <p>it's quicker to write, faster, more sophisticated and uses fewer resources than whatever you come up with.</p>

      <p>Now CSS3 animations are simplistic but they're good enough for basic website effects.</p>

      <p>You don't get the frame control you need for action games but there are better options than jQuery</p>

      <p>such as Velocity or GSAP.</p>

    <h1>Reasons to retain jQuery</h1>

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">legacy applications</li>
      <li class="fragment">where IE6/7 support is required</li>
      <li class="fragment">projects using lots of jQuery functionality</li>
      <li class="fragment">quick and dirty projects or prototypes</li>
      <li class="fragment">large teams with varying client-side skills</li>
    </ul>


    <aside class="notes">

      <p>OK, so while performance could be an issue, I'd never say you should never use jQuery. It's still a great library.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> there's little point ripping it out of legacy applications unless you have a serious performance issue</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> if you absolutely have to support IE6 and 7, well, I pity you. jQuery will help - just remember to stick with version 1.</p>

      <p>You could argue it's good for IE8 support but it's more marginal</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> if you're using a high proportion of jQuery functionality. But does your project really use every DOM methods, every Ajax type and IE8 animations?</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> perhaps you could use it for throwaway prototypes where performance isn't so much of an issue.</p>

      <p>You could use it on projects where a client wants something delivered quickly at low cost and doesn't care about quality ... but that's soul destroying work.</p>

      <p><strong>{NEXT}</strong> finally, large teams with varying skills is another possibility. But be careful not to choose jQuery because it's the easy option.</p>

      <p>You might be better to offer training, ahem, hire a freelance client-side developer.</p>

      <p>But overall, though, my main advice would be...</p>

      <li>or create a specific, modular build of jQuery</li>
    </ul>


    <aside class="notes">

      <p>Admittedly, it takes time to become a JavaScript Jedi Master. Even then, you'll still want helper functions to manage things like Ajax.</p>

      <p>If you don't want the hassle of writing those yourself or you cannot imagine life without jQuery's syntax</p>

      <p>there is a compromise in the form of micro-libraries.</p>

      <p>these mimic jQuery's API in a smaller package with better performance</p>

      <p>as you can see, min.js is only 600 bytes and is essentially a wrapper for querySelectorAll and events</p>

      <p>and jQuery itself offers custom builds. You can omit parts you don't need although it won't lead to a significant performance gain.</p>
